👋 Hi there, I'm Ayokunle Olajide!

🌱 Aspiring Full-Stack Engineer
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about coding, learning new technologies, and building applications that make a difference. Currently, I’m working on mastering full-stack development, focusing on creating seamless user experiences with efficient back-end support.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python
Front-End: React, Bootstrap
Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
Databases: MongoDB, SQL
Currently Learning: RESTful APIs, Cloud Deployment, DevOps Basics
📂 Projects

I’m in the early stages of building my portfolio and experimenting with new technologies. Here are a few of my current starter projects and learning exercises:

Interactive Portfolio Page - A simple, responsive webpage created with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to showcase my work and skills. Working on adding animations and interactive elements to make it engaging.
To-Do List App - My first JavaScript project! A basic to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Exploring React to eventually improve this with a modern, user-friendly interface.
Calculator App - A calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me understand the basics of DOM manipulation, and I'm learning to add more functionality, like keyboard input support.
Check back soon – more projects are on the way as I dive deeper into full-stack development!
🌱 Learning & Growth Goals

I'm constantly expanding my skills, and here’s what I'm focused on:

Deepening my knowledge of full-stack development with a focus on scalability.
Building more projects with React and Node.js to improve my coding patterns.
Learning the basics of DevOps for streamlined deployment and management.

🌐 Portfolio

As I continue to build my skills, I'm developing projects that showcase my journey in full-stack development. Here are some things I'm working on:

Project Goals: I’m focusing on building a portfolio of beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate my core skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My goal is to add complexity over time, such as incorporating back-end functionality and database connections.
Personal Website (Coming Soon): I’m building a personal website to share my journey, portfolio, and blog posts about what I’m learning in full-stack development. Stay tuned for updates!
Open Source Contributions: I’m actively seeking open-source projects where I can contribute and gain real-world experience. If you know of any beginner-friendly repositories, feel free to reach out!
Note: You can also check out my repositories for live demos and the code behind my projects as I continue to update them!
